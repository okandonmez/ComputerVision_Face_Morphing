# Face Detection and Morphing

This project is slightly different from normal FaceMorphing processes. That is, it involves the process of morphing a human face into a cat face, a cat face into a human face, or a human face again into a human face. Detection of human face is performed with a special library which will be explained in a while, and morphing of cat face with parameters read from file.
